Description: This packages calculates direct and diffuse components of solar radiation for a point on the earth surface. The surface is defined by geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude) with a slope and aspect with respect to the south. As solar position and angles may be obtained from an accurate solar time, the standard latitude and daylight saving parameters are also needed.     The package also returns solar angles: altitude, zenith and incidence angles. Atmospheric transmittance and diffuse coefficients are also calculated.
